# Console Colour Scheme Synchroniser (C2S2)

## ðŸš§ Work in progress, please do not use yet.

Makes command-line apps adhere to your light/dark mode settings.

Configurable and extensible.

[Learn more.](https://ar.al/2022/08/03/the-most-important-lesson-in-design/)

## System requirements

- GNOME 42+
- A colour scheme aware Terminal application like [Black Box](https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox#black-box)
- systemd

## 1. Install

ðŸ˜‡ [Download and run this installation script.](https://codeberg.org/small-tech/c2s2/raw/branch/main/install) 

ðŸ˜ˆ Or, if you enjoy living dangerously, pipe it from here to your shell (ooh, naughty!)

__Using wget:__

```shell
wget -qO- https://codeberg.org/small-tech/c2s2/raw/branch/main/install | bash
```

__Using curl:__

```shell
curl -s https://codeberg.org/small-tech/c2s2/raw/branch/main/install | bash
```

## 2. Configure

When c2s2 detects a change in the system colour scheme, it runs the corresponding configuration script at:

- __Light mode:__ _~/.config/c2s2/light_
- __Dark mode:__ _~/.config/c2s2/dark_

You configure c2s2 by adding [app configurations](./configurations.md) (little snippets of shell code) to these two scripts.

[Configure your c2s2 now.](./configurations.md)

> ðŸ’¡ The default light and dark mode scripts do not contain any app configurations and will simply log colour scheme changes to the systemd journal (which you can view using the `journalctl c2s2` to make sure c2s2 is working).

## 3. Enjoy!

Once youâ€™ve [configured c2s2](./configurations.md) to support the command-line apps on your system, it will automatically update them to use the correct theme when the system colour scheme changes.

Some apps (e.g., [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com)), may [need to be restarted](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2158#issuecomment-1201083242) for the changes to take effect.

Before visually verifying it by running your command-line apps, you can check that c2s2 is working by running `journalctl --unit c2s2` and toggling your system from light to dark mode and back. Unless youâ€™ve removed the log statements in the default light and dark configuration files, you should see c2s2 log the colour scheme changes.

## Contribute

You can contribute snippets for apps that are not already listed here by adding them to the end of the [app configurations](./configurations.md) page, updating [the table of contents](./configurations.md#table-of-contents) there, and submitting a pull request. Please feel free to use the online editor here on Codeberg to do so.
