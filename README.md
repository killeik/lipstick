## Install

Here are three ways you can install Lipstick on a Pig:

😇 [Download and run this installation script.](https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install) 

🤓 Clone this repository and run the `./install` script.

😈 Or, if you enjoy living dangerously, copy and paste one of the following commands into your terminal and run it (ooh, naughty!)

__Using wget:__

```shell
wget -qO- https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install | bash
```

__Using curl:__

```shell
curl -s https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install | bash
```

Lipstick will automatically find [supported apps](#supported-apps) on your system and configure itself. You shouldn’t have to do anything else.

## Notes

### Refreshing running apps

Some apps may need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Whenever possible, Lipstick should attempt to singal to the app that its configuration has changed and that it should reload itself. This is what it does for Helix Editor, for example.

### Fedora Silverblue

Please either install Lipstick from the host system or from a [toolbox](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/) container.

(Distrobox currently doesn’t work with systemd `--user` services in either [initful](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/380) or [initless](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/379#issuecomment-1217864773) containers and the installer will fail under a Distrobox container.)
