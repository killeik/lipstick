- A colour scheme aware Terminal application like [Black Box](https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox#black-box)
- systemd

## Supported apps

- [Bat]()
- [Delta]()
- [Helix]()

## Install

üòá [Download and run this installation script.](https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/install) 

üòà Or, if you enjoy living dangerously, pipe it from here to your shell (ooh, naughty!)

__Using wget:__

```shell
wget -qO- https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/install | bash
```

__Using curl:__

```shell
curl -s https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/install | bash
```

Lipstick will automatically find supported apps on your system and configure itself. You shouldn‚Äôt have to do anything else.

## Notes

Some apps (e.g., [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com)), may [need to be restarted](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2158#issuecomment-1201083242) for the changes to take effect.
