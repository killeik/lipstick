# üê∑ Lipstick on a Pig

Lipstick makes command-line apps follow your light/dark mode settings.

[Learn more.](https://ar.al/2022/08/03/the-most-important-lesson-in-design/)

## System requirements

- GNOME 42+
- A colour scheme aware Terminal application like [Black Box](https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox#black-box)
- systemd

## Supported apps

- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#readme)
- [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#readme)
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com)

Got an app you use that isn‚Äôt supported? Why not add it to the [lipstick-apps](src/lipstick-apps) file and submit a pull request?

## Install

üòá [Download and run this installation script.](https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install) 

üòà Or, if you enjoy living dangerously, pipe it from here to your shell (ooh, naughty!)

__Using wget:__

```shell
wget -qO- https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install | bash
```

__Using curl:__

```shell
curl -s https://codeberg.org/small-tech/lipstick/raw/branch/main/dist/install | bash
```

Lipstick will automatically find [supported apps](#supported-apps) on your system and configure itself. You shouldn‚Äôt have to do anything else.

## Notes

Some apps (e.g., [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com)), may [need to be restarted](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2158#issuecomment-1201083242) for the changes to take effect.

## Fedora Silverblue with toolbox/Distrobox (Podman containers)

There seems to be a bug with `systemd --user` services where they cannot find system binaries. I haven‚Äôt created a simple reproduction of this yet (although you can see it by running Lipstick from host and from within the default toolbox container ‚Äì `toolbox enter`).

For the time being, for Lipstick to work properly with all apps (e.g. bat, where we use bat itself ‚Äì  `bat --config-file`, etc. ‚Äì to find configuration paths) you must install it from the host system.

I‚Äôm going to open an issue about this in the relevant repository once I have a simpler reproduction.
